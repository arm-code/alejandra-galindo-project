            Yermo Schools Advisory Board The Purpose of Father Yermo Schools In
            the early 1950s, many Hispanic children in the neighborhood were
            dropping out of school after elementary grades. Parents and the
            Sisters saw the need to offer these children the possibility of
            adequate curriculum, competitive skills to promote students to
            further education; Father Yermo Elementary was born in 1958 in the
            building that hosted the old Sacred Heart Orphanage. Two years
            later, in 1960, Father Yermo High School opened its doors, in the
            old quarters built for sisters’ refuge during the religious Mexican
            persecution. Both campuses thrived, as children from the
            neighborhood and from Juarez, the sister city, began graduating. The
            new school buildings were inaugurated in 1958 and 1964.
            Accreditation was pursued and obtained in 1966. The years went by,
            and in 1988 Father Yermo Schools was the first Catholic School in
            Texas to undergo the joint dual visit from SACS-CASI and Texas
            Catholic Conference when TEA stopped accreditation of private
            schools. Faher Yermo has consistently been accredited by TCCBED, and
            is recognized as an institution that expands the excellence with
            programs that teach students according to their talents and
            aptitudes, and prepares them for their future professional
            occupation, while they develop in a family Christian environment.
            Father Yermo Schools has also witnessed the elevation of Father Jose
            Maria de Yermo to sainthood. On May 21, 2000, in St. Peter’s
            Basilica in Rome, Pope Saint John Paul II canonized Blessed Jose
            Maria de Yermo as a Saint for the Universal Church. Father Yermo
            Schools’ Family throughout the world joined in the celebrations. In
            the new millennium, Father Yermo Schools have seen expansion and
            improvements. The elementary added a new wing in order to broaden
            its services. A Capital Campaign Board was formed in 2000 to
            fundraise and built the Rudolph Miles Multipurpose Center
            inaugurated in March 2006. In 2011, the Early Learning Center
            building was blessed to host the lower elementary grades. The
            Capital Campaign Board has fundraised to build the Multipurpose
            Media Center-Library. Thousands of students have graduated from
            Father Yermo Schools embodying core Catholic values, prepared to
            pursue post-secondary education, comfortable with different
            cultures, and with a deep sense of service that brings them close to
            God and the Catholic Church.
