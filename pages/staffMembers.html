            For more than 60 years, Father Yermo Schools have faithfully served the El Paso-Juarez border community.  When in 1920 the Sisters Servants of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and of the Poor arrived in El Paso, they brought with them a charism of promotion and evangelization to the poor entrusted to them by Saint Jose Maria de Yermo y Parres. Their mission was, and will always be to provide the poor with a solid education and Catholic principles in a climate of essential values, joyfulness, and merciful love in order to affirm their human dignity.  The aim of this education is to prepare students to achieve and to become driving forces in the transformation of society.

 

            Father Yermo Schools community is aware that many families are seeking a safe, nurturing environment where their children can benefit from an excellent academic program that offers a variety of rich value-oriented experiences; young generations require this quality Catholic education to enable them to grow in mind, heart, body, and soul.
            
             
            
            Father Yermo Schools endure because of the talent and dedication of faculty and staff who day in and day out, sacrifice much to work with the Sisters’ community. It is the Faith of the Father Yermo Schools family that makes the difference in education. 
            
             
            
            Father Yermo Schools were born from the Heart of Jesus and it is in this same Heart that we find our source of life for generations and generations to come. 
            
             
            
            Sincerely, Sr. Maria Angelica Omaña, SSHJP, CAO/President
