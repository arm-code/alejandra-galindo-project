            Father Yermo Schools provide scope for religious activities which
            are directly concerned with the student’s spiritual life. In
            addition to the classroom teaching of religion, there are
            opportunities for prayer, and for celebration of the Eucharist and
            Reconciliation. Retreats and pastoral care structures complement
            what is done in the classroom. The Father Yermo Schools Program is
            enriched by the Diocesan curriculum guidelines and the direction of
            our Bishop and Pastor. The program also includes an inclusion that
            is part of the spirituality of the Sisters SSHJP, namely, a special
            devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, our Blessed Mother, and the
            Holy Founder, Saint Jose Maria de Yermo y Parres. The major areas of
            the curriculum include Biblical Studies, Ecclesial documents,
            Liturgical life, Human Promotion & Evangelization. Students learn to
            solve problems and resolve moral conflicts individually and in
            community.
