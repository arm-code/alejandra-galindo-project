            Beginning at the 7th grade, all students are required to have
            certain hours or projects of service to any local non-profit agency
            in order to involve themselves in the needs of others, and in the
            way they can fulfill themselves in a Christian way. The integration
            of academic learning and relevant service activities combine human
            dignity with self reward. Service Learning is an amazing way to
            learn the fundamental concepts of giving and collaborating. It gives
            students valuable insights into the community and real world.
            Community Service also helps to combat depression, stress and
            anxiety. It also increases self confidence and gives a sense of
            purpose. Community service provides an opportunity to be an active
            part of the community. Oder ways to Serve at Father Yermo Schools:
            Campus ministry: Students participate in different groups that
            relate to their religion program, such as, Missionary Group, Altar
            Server Preparation and Holy Childhood Association. Students also
            practice stewardship by visiting the sick, distribution of goods,
            singing for the elderly, and collection for missions. Chaplains.
            Students from 9th-12th grade may apply to participate in the
            Chaplains Club. The program has evolved since 1960 and was founded
            originally to enhance the spiritual life of the school by creating a
            Christian environment. Chaplains motivate the life of prayer, engage
            in charity and missionary work, participate in social issues
            movements, plus other related social activities. Tutoring Program.
            Father Yermo high school students are organized under a coordinator
            to help other students to keep up with their school assignments,
            homework and other skills that need improvement. Student tutors give
            their time and knowledge as a form of service and Christian
            brotherhood without any pay or retribution.
